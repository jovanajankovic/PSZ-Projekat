# PSZ-Projekat
The objective of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to predict the price of vehicles based on various characteristics such as model, year, and mileage. The dataset used for training and evaluating the model was sourced from the website www.polovniautomobili.rs. The model was developed using Python programming language and various associated libraries. Additionally, the project includes a web crawler that was utilized to collect the necessary data from the aforementioned website. All data was then stored in a database and used for model training and testing. The code and documentation for this project can be accessed in the accompanying repository.
